    This application uses a machine learning model to predict whether a given set of sonar readings
    corresponds to a **Rock** ðŸª¨ or a **Mine** ðŸ’£. The application uses a set of 60-Dimensional
    Sonar Reading, in which each value represents the energy in a specific frequency band.
    The reading is used in Submarines to distinguish between objects like mines and rocks.
