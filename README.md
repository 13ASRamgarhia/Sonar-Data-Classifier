# Sonar Data Classifier

#### [Live Demo Link](https://sonar-data-classifier.streamlit.app/)

Imagine you're trying to figure out what's on the seafloor, but you can't see anything because it's too deep or too dark. This app is like having a super-smart detective that uses (Sonar) sound waves to "see" underwater!


### What is it?
A special computer program that can tell the difference between two important things hidden underwater: rocks and mines


### How it works?
1. **Listening with Sound (Sonar):** We send out sound pulses, just like bats use echo-location. When these sound waves hit an object (a rock or a mine), they bounce back.

2. **Analyzing the Echoes:** Our program then carefully listens to the returning echoes. Different objects create slightly different echo patterns. Think of it like listening to two different instruments â€“ they sound distinct. We convert these sound patterns into a detailed "fingerprint" of 60 unique measurements.

3. **Learning from Experience:** We showed our program many, many examples of echoes from known rocks and known mines. It learned to recognize the subtle differences in their "fingerprints."

4. **Making a Guess:** Now, when it hears a new, unknown echo, it compares its "fingerprint" to all the patterns it has learned. It then makes an educated guess: "This looks more like a rock," or "This looks more like a mine."


### Why it is useful?
- **Safety:** Knowing if something is a mine (which can be dangerous!) or just a harmless rock is incredibly important for naval operations, shipping, and underwater construction.

- **Exploration:** It helps us map the seafloor and understand what's down there without having to physically go and look.


### How well it works:
After training, our program is quite good at telling the difference. It can correctly identify objects about 76% of the time when presented with new, unseen echoes. This means it's a helpful tool for initial detection and can guide further investigation.

```In short: It is a smart sonar system that helps us identify hidden underwater objects (rock or mine), making underwater activities safer and more efficient.```


### Important Considerations for Running the Script
- **Dependencies:** Ensure all required Python libraries are installed, which are as follows -> `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `pickle`
  You can install all the libraries using the following command in Command Prompt.
  ```python
  pip install pandas numpy sklearn pickle
  ```

- Make sure Python and any python IDE is installed on the system.
